Cloudflare Turnstile Solver (reverse, fully request-based)
-
#### This is out-of-date and absolutely not working. I won't provide any help in making this project work, but you can surely try by yourself!

### Q/A
- Where is WAF?
  - Definitely not in this repository
- Can I host an API with this code?
  - We do not provide any code, but you surely can if you're smart enough.
- Code sucks!
  - I know, this was my first big project in Rust, as well as my first VM reverse.  
    (if it works, it works heh)
